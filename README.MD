# Ugly Minefield 

__Unfinished project no. 1__

__A simple Minefield Java Swing app written for Mr. W's entertainment.__  
(Because he came to audit on my Software Engineering class, said that it was boring (to be fair, it **is** extremely boring...), and asked me how long it would take to program a minefield app.  

Well, it took me 3 hours to write a playable minefield java app. o.O
